						<p>Understanding the need of families today, we have designed two brackets of stay. A long term stay is offered to accommodate seniors who would require to stay on indefinitely in the home. It could be a good decision to take if you are aging and finding it challenging to live by yourself. A short term stay can be opted for by families who need their loved ones to be cared for when away on holidays, or as a respite for those who have family members who are unwell and need the elderly member to be looked after or it could just be an experiential stay at the home. Whatever the reason may be, adopt a transparent approach and  involve the elderly member in the decision. Ensure they are comfortable about choosing the option to make the transition pleasant. Hand holding your loved one during the initial stages of the stay and keeping in touch with them and enquiring about their well being is a great way to help them settle in.</p>
