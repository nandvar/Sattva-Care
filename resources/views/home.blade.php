							<p class="post-title">Life at Sattva Care</p><br><br>

							<p class="post-description">Living in Sattva Care means leading a life as a senior citizen in a safe and caring environment and enjoying the good things in life without being dependent on any family member or friend. Every resident enjoys independence and can choose to partake in a variety of activities planned on a daily basis, ranging from group discussions, group singing, dancing, reading sessions, art work, games, film/video screening, parties, picnics, outings and shopping. Residents can also participate in planning and choosing tasks and involve themselves in running their home just as a family would.</p><br><br>

							<p class="post-description">Sattva Care aims to establish an informed, resourceful and interactive senior community that works with society. Opportunities to participate in community programmes, counselling, training and socially interacting with the outside world are a part of the Outreach Programme. Sattva Care has ample space for residents to take a walk in the premises or enjoy sitting around the garden or on the terrace. A fitness routine that respects and is designed to suit each resident’s requirement through yoga, meditation and laughter therapy is an integral part of each day. Group prayers, festivities and celebrations are initiated by the home and involvement of the residents is welcomed.</p><br><br>

							<p class="post-description">Our kitchen at Sattva Care lays great emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene. We offer three delicious home style vegetarian meals, tea time snacks and mid morning fruit. Eggs can be provided on demand. Care is taken to source fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables. All ingredients used for preparing meals are of premium quality and food is prepared using mustard oil, groundnut oil, olive oil or cow’s ghee. We use cow’s milk only. When residents join our home, they specify their preferences and our chef tries to ensure he satisfies each individual to the extent possible. Residents are welcome to share recipes, or plan a meal or snacks with our cook, for everybody.</p><br><br>

							<p class="post-description">Sattva Care welcomes people of all cultures and religion. It is a place for the elderly that gives them the experience of enjoying doing things that would not always be possible in a routine life, in a planned, safe, supportive and explorative way.</p>
